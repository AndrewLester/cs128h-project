## Project Introduction
The Project focuses on creating a web application that runs a Map Reduce on any uploaded dataset along with other dataset analysis tools (To be decided) using a rust backend. The application will be tested using pre-existing datasets found from online (Will be sourced as we use them).

## System Overview
Major techincal checkpoints will include:
1) Developing a front end of some sort using html and c# styling
2) Developing a map reduce algorithm using rust to process data in a time efficient manner
3) Testing our algorithm using online datasets and publishing results
4) Develping additional data analysis tools to accompany our MapReduce

## Possible Challenges

Some possible challenges will be ...
